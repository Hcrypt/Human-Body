What are Isometric Exercises?
  An isometric exercise is a form of exercise involving the static contraction of a muscle without any visible movement in the angle of the joint. The term "isometric" combines the Greek words "Isos" (equal) and "metria" (measuring), meaning that in these exercises the length of the muscle and the angle of the joint do not change, though contraction strength may be varied.

Their are three main types of isometric exercises

1) Presses
2) Pulls
3) Holds

Unweighted isometrics
  In unweighted isometrics the exerciser uses only themselves for resistance. For example, holding a crouched position, or pressing the palms of the hands against each other. Where by the self presses against itself, this is also referred to as self-resistance or Dynamic Tension training.

Weighted isometrics:
  Involves the additional holding of a weight, and the pressing or pulling of an immovable weight or structure. For example, in a bench press set-up the barbell can be held in a fixed position and neither pushed upwards or allowed to descend. Alternatively, in a mid-thigh pull set-up, a person can attempt to pull a fixed, immovable bar upwards.

Force measurement devices for isometric actions:
1) Force measurement plate
2) Dynamometer
3) Electromyograph

What are Isotonic Contractions?
  Isotonic contractions, in which the contraction strength does not change, though the muscle length and joint angle do.

There are 2 types of isotonic contractions:

1) Concentric
  With concentric contraction, the muscle tension rises to meet the resistance, then remains the same as the muscle shortens. This type is typical of most exercise. The external force on the muscle is less than the force the muscle is generating - a shortening contraction. The effect is not visible during the classic biceps curl, which is in fact auxotonic because the resistance (torque due to the weight being lifted) does not remain the same through the exercise. Tension is highest at a parallel to the floor level, and eases off above and below this point. Therefore, tension changes as well as muscle length.
  
2) Eccentric
  With eccentric contraction, the muscle lengthens due to the resistance being greater than the force the muscle is producing. Their are 2 main features when dealing with eccentric contractions. First, the absolute tensions achieved can be very high relative to the muscle's maximum tetanic tension generating capacity (you can set down a much heavier object than you can lift. Second, the absolute tension is relatively independent of lengthening velocity.

Muscle injury and soreness are selectively associated with eccentric contraction. Muscle strengthening using exercises that involve eccentric contractions is lower than using concentric exercises. However because higher levels of tension are easier to attain during exercises that involve eccentric contractions it may be that, by generating higher signals for muscle strengthening, muscle hypertrophy is better than exercises that involve concentric contractions, albeit at a higher level of resistance.

How Do Resistance Bands Compare to Weights?

* Progressive Resistances
* Variable Speed
- Better control over concentric movements. Concentric is your positive, the Eccentric is your negative. Or if you chooose to, you can hold. Rep speed is an important variable when it comes to building muscle.
* Free-Range of Movement
* Mechancial Tension
* Linear Variable Resistance
  - The harder you stretch it, the more it creates resistances.
* Resistance in Multiple Planes
* Constant Tension

Why are Resistance Bands better?
1) Durable
2) Verstile
3) Easy to store
4) Easy to transport
