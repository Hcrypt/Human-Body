Humans are designed to breath through their nose at rest. The only time you should be breathing through your mouth is when your body is at a very intense metabolic demand like when you're running.

Their are few reasons why humans why design to breath through their nose.
  * Their are tiny little hair that filters out particles additional gases from our sinuses like nitrous. Nitrous is mixed through the air when we breathe through our nose.
  * Their are things that are nodes that are tied in with the parasympathetic nervous system that relaxes you.
  * The nose humidifies the air by moisting it a bit before it goes into the lungs which is a better way to breath so it doesn't dry out your lungs.

The mouth is a very inefficient way to get airway to get oxygen into the lungs. The mouth is their just for you to do that as well as eat and drink.

3 Biggest Benefits to breathing through your nose:
  1) Breathing through your nose can help stop the development of forward head posture. Mouth breathing is associated with forward posture because when you're breathing through your mouth, you're getting activation on your sternocleidomastoid and scalenes muscle. When that happens, your upper tracks on the neck are turned on. If it shortens, your head gets pulled forward. Breathing through your nose helps prevents that.
  
  The scalene muscle and the sternocleidomastoid muscle are flexors of the neck bones and play a role in the posture control of the neck. Consistent forward head posture shortens and weakens these muscles, resulting in weakened breathing
  
  More about this can be looked up here in this research:
  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5788792/
  
  When your mouth is open, your tongue can't be placed on the roof of the mouth. The tip of your tongue should be right behind your teeth. When that happens, it activates the cervical flexor muscles on your neck which helps to keep your neck back and your jaw relax because as you're breathing through your mouth, that tongue position is going to be thown off further leading to forward head posture.
  
  2) By breathing through your nose, it will help your body utilize the oxygen that's in your bloodstream more effectively by preventing overbreathing. Most people over breathe in and out too much because they're using their mouth.
  
  Although the common belief that people aren't breathing enough or is taking shallow breath is true, it is also true that breathing through the mouth too much can create too much exchanges of gases. Ultimately what happens is that when you're breathing through your mouth, you're expelling too much carbon dioxide which is actually not a waste gas. CO^2 is very necessary in our blood because it help regulates the uptake of the oxygen in our blood. This is called the "Bohr effect".

  If you breath through your nose more, you will really lower the amount of over breathing that your body may or may not be doing on a chronic regular basis. By breathing through your nose more, you're basically increasing your body's ability to utilize oxygen.
  
  3) Breathing through the nose activates the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system is a part of the autonomic nervous system which is a part of your nervous systems that you don't have conscious control over. It will tell your body to calm down, relax and it can focus on healing because you're not over respirating and your telling your body you're in a safe place.
  
Autonomic Nervous System:

   - Parasympathetic Nervous System = breath or feed response
        When your body is parasympathetic, your body can better repair it's ablility to focus on digestion, healing, relaxing.
        
   - Sympathetic Nervous System = fight or flight response
        When your body is sympathetic and you're under stress all the time, your bodys cortisol is elevated. It will shutdown cellular repair like the digestion and things like that because your body will view it as if those things aren't critical to your surival. If you're in Sympathetic all the time, then you will chronically be stressed.
        
TO REDUCE CHRONIC STRESS, understand how to breath through your nose to bring you to a parasympathetic state.

1) Dirgha Pranayama (Three-Part Breath)
 a practice of slowing and deepening the breath
 
2) Nadi Shodhana (Alternate-Nostril breath (ANB))
 touted for its ability to reduce stress and still the mind

3) Kapalabhati/Bhastrika (Skull-Polishing breath)
 consists of a forceful exhalation and a passive inhalation
 
4) Bhastrika (Belly-breathing)
 similar to Kapalabhati and it also is meant to be used to increase energy flow. Bhastrika is practiced by breathing fully and forcefully in and out of the nose.

Spinal Stability During Breathing | Core Muscles

https://youtu.be/6U51WQswy3Q

Early mathematical models stated that the force that's placed on the Spine during weightlifting actually far exceeds the force that's required to ruptured discs or even fracture isolated vertebrae so the question then is how do individuals lift such heavy weight without breaking their back?

The answer has to do with "pressure". Specifically, it has something to do with maintaining a high intra-abdominal this is a high pressure inside of your abdominal cavity. That's where all your disgestive organs are.

How do you maintain a high pressure in your abdomen? Well first thing we need to do is, be aware of "Boyle's law".

Boyle's law:
A law stating that the pressure of a given mass of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to its volume at a constant temperature.

Because of "Boyle's law", if you have a container, if you decrease the volume of that container, you increase the pressure in that container. Vice versa, if you increase the volume of the container, you decrease the pressure inside.

Now, we know that our abdomen is surrounded by abdominal muscles. You have the "rectus abdominus", "transversus abdominus", "external/internal obliques" for example and if you contract them, what you end up crunching. Because you flex up the abdomen, that decreases the volume of your abdominal cavity.

Decrease the Volume = Increase the Pressure inside your abdominals

Now, inside your abdomen, you've got disgestive organs. This is solids and liquids. It's basically "incompressible", so that means when you increase the pressure inside, things don't shift around very much. It then becomes quote a stiff and rigid environment.

Remember, at the back of your abdomen, you've got your lumbar vertebra which means it's like when you deep when you increase the intra-abdominal pressure. It's like blowing up a balloon inside which means it makes this spine more stiff, it can then withhold more compressive forces.

In addition to that, your "transversus abdominus" and "external/internal obliques" is attached to your rectus spinal muscles. These are the main muscles that allow our back to extend and take alot of that force so that neabs that when you contract those muscles, it also aids near active spinal muscles to help redistribute the force as well.

So not just the intra-abdominal pressure, but also contraction of the abdominal muscles help reduce the force that has been placed on the spine and also increase the stiffness we see in the spine as well.

Now, in addition to that what're going to find is that when you decrease that abdominal cavity increasing the pressure it also increases the pressure in the thoracic cavity and when you increase the pressure in the thoracic cavity. When you squeeze the lungs, air comes out. Now if you continue to decrease the volume of the abdominal cavity through compression or contraction of the muscles.

Remember, your external obliques aren't just around your abdomen, but they attach to the lower eight ribs and when you contract the external obliques they're going to drop the ribcage inwards decreasing the thoracic volume as well hench why the thoracic volume decreases and air wants to rush out.

So if you want to maintain a high intra-abdominal pressure, then you need to close that airway. Closing that airway means the thoracic volume won't continue to decrease maintaining the rigid abdominal structure.

Now this is probably not as important in back squat for example because in back squat you take that load and as you start to stand up, you start to breath out. As you breathe out, you further contract more and more and more abdominal muscles increasing that intra-abdominal pressure. But, when if you're during a bench pressure, that force isn't necessarily being placed vertically on your spine, it's actually being placed on your chest and arms and being distributed across your thoracic cavity so the weight of the bench press is actually decreasing the volume of the thoracic cavity. What does that mean? It means an increase in pressure. Air wants to rush out if it does, then you're not going to maintain a strong chest wall during the benchpress.

If you, then close the "glottis" or "airways", the force is going to be redistributed to your abdomen, now that means, you need to maintain a strong core during bench press because if you relax the ABs, the force will then be pushed down to your abdomen as well.

So, in short, by contracting the abdominal muscles maintaining an increased intra-abdominal pressure, you maintain an increased interest thoracic pressure and then you have greater stability across the chest during a bench press.
