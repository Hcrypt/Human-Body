Humans are designed to breath through their nose at rest. The only time you should be breathing through your mouth is when your body is at a very intense metabolic demand like when you're running.

Their are few reasons why humans why design to breath through their nose.
  * Their are tiny little hair that filters out particles additional gases from our sinuses like nitrous. Nitrous is mixed through the air when we breathe through our nose.
  * Their are things that are nodes that are tied in with the parasympathetic nervous system that relaxes you.
  * The nose humidifies the air by moisting it a bit before it goes into the lungs which is a better way to breath so it doesn't dry out your lungs.

The mouth is a very inefficient way to get airway to get oxygen into the lungs. The mouth is their just for you to do that as well as eat and drink.

3 Biggest Benefits to breathing through your nose:
  1) Breathing through your nose can help stop the development of forward head posture. Mouth breathing is associated with forward posture because when you're breathing through your mouth, you're getting activation on your sternocleidomastoid and scalenes muscle. When that happens, your upper tracks on the neck are turned on. If it shortens, your head gets pulled forward. Breathing through your nose helps prevents that.
  
  The scalene muscle and the sternocleidomastoid muscle are flexors of the neck bones and play a role in the posture control of the neck. Consistent forward head posture shortens and weakens these muscles, resulting in weakened breathing
  
  More about this can be looked up here in this research:

  When your mouth is open, your tongue can't be placed on the roof of the mouth. The tip of your tongue should be right behind your teeth. When that happens, it activates the cervical flexor muscles on your neck which helps to keep your neck back and your jaw relax because as you're breathing through your mouth, that tongue position is going to be thown off further leading to forward head posture.
  
  2) By breathing through your nose, it will help your body utilize the oxygen that's in your bloodstream more effectively by preventing overbreathing. Most people over breathe in and out too much because they're using their mouth.
  
  Although the common belief that people aren't breathing enough or is taking shallow breath is true, it is also true that breathing through the mouth too much can create too much exchanges of gases. Ultimately what happens is that when you're breathing through your mouth, you're expelling too much carbon dioxide which is actually not a waste gas. CO^2 is very necessary in our blood because it help regulates the uptake of the oxygen in our blood. This is called the "Bohr effect".

  If you breath through your nose more, you will really lower the amount of over breathing that your body may or may not be doing on a chronic regular basis. By breathing through your nose more, you're basically increasing your body's ability to utilize oxygen.
  
  3) Breathing through the nose activates the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system is a part of the autonomic nervous system which is a part of your nervous systems that you don't have conscious control over. It will tell your body to calm down, relax and it can focus on healing because you're not over respirating and your telling your body you're in a safe place.
  
Autonomic Nervous System:

   - Parasympathetic Nervous System = breath or feed response
        When your body is parasympathetic, your body can better repair it's ablility to focus on digestion, healing, relaxing.
        
   - Sympathetic Nervous System = fight or flight response
        When your body is sympathetic and you're under stress all the time, your bodys cortisol is elevated. It will shutdown cellular repair like the digestion and things like that because your body will view it as if those things aren't critical to your surival. If you're in Sympathetic all the time, then you will chronically be stressed.
        
TO REDUCE CHRONIC STRESS, understand how to breath through your nose to bring you to a parasympathetic state.
